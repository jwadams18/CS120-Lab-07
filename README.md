# CS120-Lab-07
Modified version of Lab-05 (previous work), which now displays baseball cards via a table interface

## **Problem** 
Keeping up with currently owned baseball cards
<br>
## **Solution**
Create a GUI similar to one made before but improve it to display the baseball cards via a table.  
<br> 
Each card will have the basic stats desired for a baseball card, the name, position, age, team, years played in the MLB, the condition of the card, rarity of the card,
and whether or not the user would want to trade. The GUI will allow the user to add a new card, edit, view their cards. However, with little modification
the GUI can be adapted to display/track/store many different types of things.
